## About 

An awesome vim configuration that is used by me in everyday life.

## Installation

To install it in a few minutes, simply run:
`git clone git@bitbucket.org:idvoretskyi/vimrc.git ~/vimrc`

The full list of plugins one may find in `'~/.vim/plugins.vim'` file. To add any
new plugin, simply add it to that file.

Example: I'd like to add the NERD tree plugin.
I have to simply run `echo "Plugin 'scrooloose/nerdtree' >> ~/.vim/plugins.vim` and `vim +PluginInstall +qall` for that.
