An awesome vim configuration that is used by me in everyday life.

To install it in a few minutes, simply run:
`git clone git@bitbucket.org:idvoretskyi/vimrc.git ~/vimrc`

The full list of plugins one may find in '.vim/plugins.vim' file. To add any
new plugin, simply run `echo "Plugin 'plugin/source' >> .vim/plugins.vim`
